Installation of mtx should be a matter of

	cd mtx
	./autoconf.sh
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

Building the mtx native functions requires that the source code for GNU APL 
be available.  The build process will try to find the source (using 
apl --show_src_dir) but if it fails, the location can be set manually
during configure

	./configure --apl-source-dir=<source dir>

(Doing this requires that the autotools (autoconf, automake, and libtools) 
be installed.)

The GNU gsl package must also be installed.

mtx supports eigenvalues and eigenvectors, but only if the Eigen3 package is
present and is detected in the ./configure step.  Eigen3 comes with or is
available with some Linux distribtions, and is available at
eigen.tuxfamily.org
