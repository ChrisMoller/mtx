Installation of mtx should be a matter of

	cd mtx
	./autoconf.sh
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

Building the mtx native functions requires that the source code for GNU APL 
be available.  The build process will try to find the source (using 
apl --show_src_dir) but if it fails, the location can be set manually
during configure

	./configure --apl-source-dir=<source dir>

(Doing this requires that the autotools (autoconf, automake, and libtools) 
be installed.)
